MIDDLEWARE -> IT works btw request and response
                                      next()        next()                  (manipulate)next()              (Response)
    (i) Request -> Middleware(Server)-------->Mid2--------->Mid3......->midn------------------> handler ------------------> client
    - Request first goes to MIDDLEWARE in the server and can forward that request to the next middleware or  handler after manipulating he response is send to the client

                                                (mnaipulate) sends as response
    (ii) Request --------> Middleware(Server)-----------------------------------> client
    - Middleware can also manipulate the req and and send it as reponse to the client
    eg. 
            app.use((req, res, next)=>{
            console.log("Middleware 2");
            res.send("Response send by middlware2") //yha pr middleware direct request send kr rha client ko. Isliye iske baad ka koi code execute nhi hoga
            })



    next() -> it sends req to next middleware or handler

Types of Middleware

(i)Application level Middleware -> jb koi reques aayegi to wo middleware me jaegi  
(ii) Route level Middleware -> jb koi route ke liye request jaegi to us route ko execute krne ke phle
(iii) Error Handling Middleware ->General Catch Handler(koi bhi error aayegi kisi bhi middleware , routes ya handler pr ye catch krlega)
    eg. app.use((err, req, res, next)=>{})
